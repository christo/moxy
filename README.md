# moxy
a tiny, toy mock object framework in javascript

You don't need a mock object framework, but if you don't use one (like sinon) then testing and ad hoc mocking tends to 
cause a certain amount of repetition (which is bad, because DRY). As a fun exercise I made just enough mock framework
to remote this repetition from my tests and this is that.
